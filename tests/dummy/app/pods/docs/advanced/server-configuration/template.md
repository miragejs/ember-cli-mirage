# Server configuration

The MirageJS server is configured for you by ember-cli-mirage. However, if you need to customize the server you can by creating a makeServer function in the config.js.

The named `makeServer` function export gives you a lower-level way to hook
  into how your Ember app instantiates your Mirage JS server.

  Typically, the `/mirage/config.js` file contains a single default export which
  is a function defining all your Mirage route handlers. Ember CLI Mirage then
  uses this function, along with all the other modules you've defined in
  `mirage/models`, `mirage/fixtures`, `mirage/factories`, and
  `mirage/serializers`, to create your Mirage JS server when your app boots up
  in development and testing.

  You can now opt in to having more control over exactly how your Mirage server
  is instantiated, as well as the ability to use imports directly from the
  `miragejs` npm package, by exporting a single named function called
  `makeServer` instead.

  `makeServer` receives a single argument called `config`, which contains all
  the factory/fixture/serializer/model modules that exist in your project's
  `/mirage` directory. This saves you from having to import each module
  explicitly and then pass it into your Mirage server, just like you're used to
  with the default setup.

  The `config` argument maps exactly to everything inside of your `/mirage`
  directory - notably, it does not contain the autogenerated Mirage model
  definitions derived from your Ember Data models, which is an important feature
  of Ember CLI Mirage that is enabled by default. To replicate this behavior
  when using `makeServer`, we have provided an additional import called
  `discoverEmberDataModels` from the `ember-cli-mirage` package that you can use
  to augment your config with these models so that your Mirage schema is
  automatically inferred from your host application's Ember Data models and
  relationships. The snippet below shows how to do this. Note that the order
  here matters if you also have models defined in your `/mirage/models`
  directory, as those model definitions would "win" in the event of a conflict
  with the ones autodiscovered from Ember Data. (However, most of time if you
  are inferring your Mirage schema from Ember Data, you shouldn't need to define
  additional models.)

  Finally, your route handlers just need to be passed to the `routes()` key in
  your Mirage config. You can do this inline, or you can make them a separate
  function, and organize that function however you choose.

  The only thing needed to enable this behavior is that you delete the default
  function export and instead export a single named function called
  `makeServer`. You should also add `miragejs` to your project's dependencies in
  your `package.json` file, since you are now importing directly from it. Note
  that this gives you the added benefit of being able to upgrade `miragejs`
  independently of `ember-cli-mirage`.

  Eventually, `ember-cli-mirage` will shed its re-exports of everything from
  `miragejs`, and become a small wrapper library delegating the rest of the work
  to `miragejs`. This will help align the Ember Mirage users with the rest of
  the Mirage JS community. 
```javascript

// Example with inline routes
import { createServer, discoverEmberDataModels } from "ember-cli-mirage";

export function makeServer(config) {
  let finalConfig = {
    ...config,
    models: { ...discoverEmberDataModels(), ...config.models },
    routes() {
      // this.namespace = '/api'

      // this.resource('user')
    },
  };

  return createServer(finalConfig);
}

// Example with routes in an external function
import { createServer, discoverEmberDataModels } from "ember-cli-mirage";

export function makeServer(config) {
  let finalConfig = {
    ...config,
    models: { ...discoverEmberDataModels(), ...config.models },
    routes,
  };

  return createServer(finalConfig);
}

function routes() {
  // this.namespace = '/api'

  // this.resource('user')
}
```

## Serializers

If you would like to have Mirage adjust or create your serializers for you from your ember data serializers adjust your 
server configuration to have mirage perform this for you.

When Mirage auto discovers your ember data models, should you also have the same model defined in mirage, it will use the mirage
version of the model. With serializers, you may have created a mirage serializer to override some methods, but would still 
like Mirage to apply the primaryKey and transforms. For that reason the method to apply these properties is different than
the way you merge the models.

`applyEmberDataSerializers` will apply the `primaryKey` and `attrs` from your ember data serializers to your mirage serializers.
If you have not created a mirage serializer it will create one and extend it from your mirage application serializer.
Ensure your application serializer extends from EmberDataSerializer as the default JSONApiSerializer will not understand 
how to use `primaryKey` and `transforms`. If you have not created a mirage serializer named application, the created serializer 
will extend EmberDataSerializer directly.

```javascript
// Example of having Mirage adjust/create your serializers similiar to ember data models
import { createServer, discoverEmberDataModels, applyEmberDataSerializers } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export function makeServer(config) {
  let finalConfig = {
    ...config,
    models: { ...discoverEmberDataModels(), ...config.models },
    serializers: applyEmberDataSerializers(config.serializers),
    routes,
  };

  return createServer(finalConfig);
}

function routes() {
  // this.namespace = '/api'

  // this.resource('user')
}
```
